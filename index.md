## About

FreeCodeCamp is a non profit initiative for anyone to learn to code. [Visit website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## FreeCodeCamp BCN

Welcome to FreeCodeCamp Barcelona. Anyone that wants to learn to code is welcome to our meetups. Currently we organize every 2 weeks on Tuesday our meetups. Come alone or with friends and meet other people that are starting to program. The goal of the meetups is to gather people of all levels so they can exchange experience and advice on getting familiar with programming.

People with any level of experience are more than welcome to advice, assist or coach the FreeCodeCamp students.

## Questions

### Do I need to sign up before coming to a meetup?
No need.

### What is the minimum level to join a meetup?
There is none, any level is fine. There are people present from all kind of levels that can help each other. Any small or simple question is a good question. Don't be afraid to ask silly questions, for most this an entire new field that they're exploring. There is no prestige.

### is this an official meetup?
No, FreeCodeCamp is non profit and encourages meetups but there is no such thing as an "Official" meetup. Everyone is free to organize or host one. If you would like to organize one yourself, you are free to do so. We are always open to join forces or sit down together to share our experiences.

### Is it free?
Yes, it's non profit

### What shoul I bring?
A laptop if you want to team up with others or want help with your own projects.

### Do I need to speak English?
No you don't, it is true that the students exists out of a very international mix, you're not required to be fluent in English. Note that the primary communication regarding the meetups will be conducted in English, but you're free to talk during the meetups in the language you're comfortable in.
